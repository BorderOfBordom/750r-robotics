	<h2>What is VEX?</h2>
	<p>VEX Robotics was created as a solution to the growing need for people in STEM fields of work.
       By educating children about engineering principles and the design process, VEX hopes to prepare
	   students for a job in science, technology, and mathematics. To this end, VEX uses games and competitions
	   to bring fun to learning, with this year's competition being Turning Point.</p>

	<h2>This Year's Game</h2>
	<p>Turning Point is a game in which two alliances of two teams each compete to score as many
       points as possible by flipping caps and toggling flags. The game features an autonomous section, during which
	   the robot acts without driver input, and a driver control section, which tests the skills of the alliances'
	   drive teams.</p>
